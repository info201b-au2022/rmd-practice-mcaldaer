## Covid Report
My name is **Madeleine Clarke** and today I am learning how to use _R Markdown_. I will highlight that the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 

~~(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)~~ Yes, I can 

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
